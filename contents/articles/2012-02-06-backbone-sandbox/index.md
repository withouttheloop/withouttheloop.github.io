Backbone.js Sandbox
===================

If you are working with Backbone.js it is handy to have a sandbox environment for testing simple things. 

This [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/ynkJE/) has jQuery, backbone and underscore already loaded. Type your code in the JavaScript text area, as well as markup and css in their respective text areas as required, and click the run button. I use it all the time.
