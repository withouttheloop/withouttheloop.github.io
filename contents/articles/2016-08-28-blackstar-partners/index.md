Development of [Blackstar CMS](https://blackstarcms.net/) has progressed well and we now have a product that is ready for early users. Recently, we have added [a backup system](http://withouttheloop.com/articles/2016-07-03-blackstar-backup/), [secure connections via SSL/TLS](http://withouttheloop.com/articles/2016-07-04-blackstar-ssl/) and [security features for authentication and authorization](http://withouttheloop.com/articles/2016-08-05-blackstar-security/).

> Beta partners will receive a free 12-month license and personal assistance integrating Blackstar CMS into their application. 

If you have a application that will benefit from content management please reply to this email and request access to the beta program.  

If you would like to trial Blackstar CMS outside of the beta program you can [download the latest builds for Windows and Linux](https://blackstarcms.net/install.html).
