Many people like the pomodoro technique because it helps them focus intently on tasks. It is also helpful for preventing interruptions. If your team, and extended team, know that you are in the middle of a pomodoro then they know to avoid interrupting you. But how do you communicate that you have a pomodoro in progress? 

Team Pomodoro combines a tradtional pomodoro timer and a dashboard showing the status of each team member's pomodoros. A person can see at a glance who is currently available and when each person will be available.
