The last 20 years have shown that product development needs to be considered broadly, from, “we have no idea what we are going to do” all the way to retiring a successful product. The old idea that product development begins with software developers implementing perfectly defined features has become uncompetitive.
An effective product development organisation needs to master technology strategy and design. Marty Cagan (author of Inspired) is possibly the most articulate voice promoting this idea and explaining how to do it.
