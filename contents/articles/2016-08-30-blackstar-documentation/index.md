Blackstar CMS now has a [proper documentation site](https://blackstarcms.net/docs/).

It is a work in progress, however, the [.net client](https://blackstarcms.net/docs/client/dotnetclient/), [JavaScript client](https://blackstarcms.net/docs/client/javascriptclient/), [security](https://blackstarcms.net/docs/server/security/) and [API/Keys](https://blackstarcms.net/docs/admin/apikeys/) are all populated.
