The Blackstar CMS now has a usable feature set. You can:
-------------------

* Create and edit content, with [a fancy new markdown editor](https://demo.blackstarcms.net/newChunk)
* [Tag and search for content](https://demo.blackstarcms.net/search)
* [Work with media assets](https://demo.blackstarcms.net/media) (non-image media still needs work)
* Pull content using the [JavaScript client](https://github.com/Blackstar-CMS/javascript-client)
* Pull content using the [.net client](https://github.com/Blackstar-CMS/dotnet-client)
* Install Blackstar CMS as a service on Windows or Linux (more on this later)

Things that Blackstar CMS still cannot do, but will soon:
----------------

* Be reliably used in production
* Provide authentication and authorization for content access and administration
* Provide built-in SSL/TLS support 

Install Blackstar CMS as a service on Windows or Linux
------------------------------------------------------

Installation packages are now available for Windows and Linux. To receive access to the installation packages, along with install instructions, [join the Blackstar CMS mailing list](https://blackstarcms.net/#stayintouch). 

If you are already on the list you will receive a link to the download soon.
