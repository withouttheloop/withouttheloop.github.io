          <section class="content"><p><img src="/articles/2013-05-30-reading-code/cave.jpg" align="left" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;" alt="spelunking"/> Scott Hanselman has or had a series called <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheWeeklySourceCode59AnOpenSourceTreasureIronyNETLanguageImplementationKit.aspx">the weekly source code</a>, in which he reviewed open source code as a learning exercise. I have enjoyed looking through the source of <a href="https://github.com/meanpath/robots">robots-txt</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mwotton">Mark Wotton</a> so I will follow Mr Hanselman’s lead and document my experience spelunking this&nbsp;source.</p>
<h2 id="robots-txt-cabal">robots-txt.cabal</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed, in the root of the repository, is the robots-txt.cabal file. This file defines how the project will be packaged for use as a dependency of other projects and also the dependencies of the current project for installation. robots-txt is defined as a library, meaning that it exports things to be used in other applications and does not have its own&nbsp;executable. </p>
<p>Below the standard package definition robots-txt.cabal includes a setting I have not seen before, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html">test-suite</a>. robots-txt uses the older exitcode-stdio-1.0 + main-is style of test suite ‘that indicate test failure with a non-zero exit code’. Adding the test-suite configuration means that the project’s tests can be run with <code>cabal test</code>. Yet another reason to add cabal configuration to all projects, not just the ones that are intended to be distributed as cabal&nbsp;packages.</p>
<p>The usage of <code>hs-source-dirs</code> for both the library and test-suite configuration is also&nbsp;interesting. </p>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>The robots-txt.cabal file defines the entry point for testing as test/Spec.hs. Spec.hs references <a href="https://github.com/sol/hspec-discover">hspec-discover</a> in a GHC_OPTIONS pragma. hspec-discover looks for and executes all tests in the directory and any subdirectories. This is a convenient way to avoid having to maintain a list of tests to execute. In the case of robots-txt there is only one test file to discover&nbsp;test/RobotSpec.hs.</p>
<h3 id="robotspec-hs">RobotSpec.hs</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/meanpath/robots/blob/master/test/RobotSpec.hs">RobotSpec.hs</a> uses <a href="http://hspec.github.io/">hspec</a> and the specification style of tests to define the behaviour of the project. It is curious that this style (describe… it… should) is popular on so many platforms and yet I have not seen a .<span class="caps">NET</span>&nbsp;implementation. </p>
<p>RobotSpec.hs uses the <code>{-# LANGUAGE CPP #-}</code> pragma, which allows it to use the special symbol <strong><span class="caps">FILE</span></strong> which is presumably replaced by the current filename pre&nbsp;compilation. </p>
<p>I don’t understand how RobotSpec is executed, since it doesn’t declare a main function like the hspec examples and it doesn’t export&nbsp;anything. </p>
<p>At first I didn’t understand the use of forM_, but a bit of googling, and particularly <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5856709/what-is-the-difference-between-liftm-and-mapm-in-haskell">this stackoverflow question</a> provided some&nbsp;insight.</p>
<h3 id="network-http-robots">Network.<span class="caps">HTTP</span>.Robots</h3>
<p>The actual program is contained within the <a href="https://github.com/meanpath/robots/blob/master/src/Network/HTTP/Robots.hs">Network.<span class="caps">HTTP</span>.Robots module</a>. It defines a number of data structures and some functions for operating on them. Some of it is confusing to me, such as the directiveP function. I suspect I need to spend some more time with&nbsp;Control.Applicative</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking through Robots has been both fun and enlightening. The code is simple enough for me to understand (mostly) and it is small enough to be easily digestable. I’ve learnt a few things, particularly about how to setup testing which is an area that I have been planning to&nbsp;improve. </p>
