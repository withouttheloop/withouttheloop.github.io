          <section class="content"><p>Spelunking through a program recently I started to think about my coding style, particularly in C#. It occurred to me that my style is most easily defined in terms of the things that I try to avoid. Here is a quick list of things to avoid, in C#, where&nbsp;practical.</p>
<p>Most of the justification for these exclusions is in my presentation <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8948049/fp/dddbrisbane2012-master/reveal.js/index.html">Why Functional Programming&nbsp;Matters</a></p>
<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
<p>I don’t like explicit loops, for and foreach. Use linq when querying. Explicit loops are better when mutating state but let’s avoid that too. Recursion is also an&nbsp;option. </p>
<h2 id="conditional-if-">Conditional&nbsp;(if)</h2>
<p>Null checking type conditionals can be replaced with null coallescion in a variant of the null object&nbsp;pattern:</p>
<pre><code>(callback ?? ()=&gt; {})();
</code></pre><p>Polymorphism allows types to replace explicit conditionals. Tell don’t ask can also eliminate conditionals. Finally, the conditional operator (?:) is preferable to the if statement because it is an&nbsp;expression.</p>
<h2 id="switch-statement-">Switch&nbsp;statement </h2>
<p>Switch is a particularly nasty special case of&nbsp;conditionals.</p>
<p>Avoid by using polymorphism or convert to a dictionary (declarative instead of&nbsp;imperative). </p>
<h2 id="statements-">Statements </h2>
<p>C# make these hard to avoid because many C# language feature are not expressions. The solution is to use language features that are expression oriented, like linq, factor functions properly and write pure functions. Variable declarations are ok if they make code more&nbsp;readable.</p>
<h2 id="mutable-state">Mutable&nbsp;state</h2>
<p>Don’t have it if you don’t need it. Return copies of&nbsp;things.</p>
<h2 id="state-mutations">State&nbsp;mutations</h2>
<p>As&nbsp;above.</p>
<h2 id="async">async</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">TPL</span> is great when you need to do something asynchronously, but it is viral in the sense that all callers become async too. Don’t use async/TPL without a good reason and do it as shallow in the callstack as possible. Separate async / IO code from pure&nbsp;code </p>
<h2 id="null">null</h2>
<p>Null is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare</a>‘s&nbsp;fault. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (<span class="caps">ALGOL</span> W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty&nbsp;years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Lippert seems to&nbsp;agree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even this is essentially an accident of history; it just so happened that when C# was first implemented it had always-nullable reference types, non-nullable value types, and no generic types at all. In a counterfactual world where the <span class="caps">CLR</span> had generic types from the get-go, it seems plausible that Nullable<T> could have been implemented to work on any type, and reference types would then be non-nullable by default. We could have a type system where Nullable<string> was the only legal way to represent “a string that can be null”. Keep this in mind the next time you design a new type&nbsp;system!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give references default values and design types that don’t contain null members. No more null reference&nbsp;exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="ref-and-out-params">ref and out&nbsp;params</h2>
<p>It is often (always?) possible to replace ref and out params with other options, such as pre-testing&nbsp;values. </p>
